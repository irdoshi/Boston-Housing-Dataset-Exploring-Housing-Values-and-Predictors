# Exploring-Housing-Values-and-Predictors-in-Boston-Dataset

In this project I:

- Created scatterplots to visualize the relationships between the response variable and predictors.
- Fitted simple linear regression models for each predictor and analyzed the regression output.
- Interpreted the slope of the predictors and assessed their statistical significance.
- Explored the possible social processes that contribute to neighborhood house prices.
- Compared the results from simple regression models to those from multiple regression models.
- Conducted multiple regression analysis using all predictors and evaluated the significance of each predictor.
- Interpreted the results for specific predictors, such as room average, poverty rate, and race.
- Examined the association between age, housing density, and the number of 311 calls.
- Compared the number of calls in similar neighborhoods in Philadelphia and Austin.
